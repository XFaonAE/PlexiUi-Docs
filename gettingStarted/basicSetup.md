## Basic Setup
Now let's setup a basic project to work with

## Preparation
First let's run the usual init task for NPM
```bash
npm init
```

## Installation
Let's install [Axeri Framework Manager](https://github.com/AxeriDev/FrameworkManager) into our project
```bash
npm install github:AxeriDev/FrameworkManager
```

Now lets install PlexiUI
```bash
npx axeri-framework-manager install PlexiUi
```

You will see lots of activity, once it says it's finished your ready to start using PlexiUI!

## Starting The App
The framework is now ready to be started! Now let's start our app.
```bash
npm run app:dev
```
This command will start a development server and soon launch the app.
